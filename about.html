                <p>
                    I currently work as a Systems Engineer II for Honeywell Aerospace. 
                    I have been working for nearly 2 years working on cybersecurity 
                    processes and risk assessments. I obtained my <i>Bachelor's in 
                    Computer Science</i> in May 2022, and I enjoy writing desktop,
                    web, and console applications in my free time. I am <b>CompTIA Security+
                    certified</b> (SY0-701) as of May 2024.

                <h2 class="section-header">Accomplishments</h2>
                <p>
                    My greatest achievement is <b>graduating college and university 
                    debt-free</b>. I'd say that my websites, especially my Verse game, 
                    this website, and my r6siege sites are among my favorite accomplishments.
                    I am also proud of how many of the OEIS sequences I have programmed 
                    in Go, and of course my Security+ certification.

                    This chart shows the languages and libraries that I use. I have spent
                    lots of time building my websites, with additional time spent with
                    Go, Python, C/C++, and Java. Despite spending the most time programming
                    in Web, I would say that <b>Go is my favorite language</b>.
