                <p>
                    For over 2 years, I have been working as a Systems Engineer (now level II) for
                    Honeywell Aerospace. I have worked on processes and risk assessments, plus
                    reviewing products for cybersecurity principles and design. Lately, however,
                    I have been working with cutting edge Generative AI ("GenAI") technologies,
                    developing new ways to improve a pilot's workload in the cockpit. 
                    <br><br>
                    I obtained my <i>Bachelor's in Computer Science</i> in May 2022, and I enjoy 
                    writing desktop, web, and console applications in my free time. I am <b>CompTIA
                    Security+ certified</b> (SY0-701) as of May 2024.

                <h2 class="section-header">Accomplishments</h2>
                <p>
                    My greatest achievement is <b>graduating college and university 
                    debt-free</b>. I'd say that my websites, especially my Verse game
                    and my Sudoku cross-platform app are among my favorite accomplishments.
                    I am also proud of how many of the OEIS sequences I have programmed 
                    in Go, and of course my Security+ certification.

                <h2 class="section-header">Programming Languages & Libraries</h2>
                <p>
                    This chart shows the languages and libraries that I use. I have spent
                    lots of time building my websites, with additional time spent with
                    Go, Python, C/C++, Flutter, and Java. Despite spending the most time 
                    programming in Web, I would say that <b>Go is my favorite language</b>.
                    Professionally, I end up working with Python and C/C++ the most.

                <h2 class="section-header">Programming Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my experience in programming, I have become acquainted with various
                    programming concepts. These include fundamental skills like <b>designing 
                    algorithms</b>, data structures, dependency management, I/O, string 
                    manipulation, etc. These skills culminate in more complex skills, like working
                    with <b>Windows and Linux CLIs</b>, new technologies like <b>machine learning 
                    and cutting edge GenAI</b>, and more.

                <h2 class="section-header">Cybersecurity Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    Regarding cybersecurity, I have worked on <b>risk assessments</b>, Aerospace
                    certification documents, process documentation, <b>threat modelling</b>,
                    and reviews for cybersecurity.

                <h2 class="section-header">Tools</h2>
                <p>
                    I have used dozens of different tools throughout my career, too many to name.
                    Some of these include: <b>GitHub</b>, <b>Atlassian JIRA & Bitbucket</b>, CMake,
                    and GDB. Some more general tools include <b>Adobe Acrobat</b>, and I also have 
                    <i>two decades</i> of experience with Microsoft Office (since Office 2003).

                <h2 class="section-header">Development Environments</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>Visual Studio Code</i> is my preferred development environment. I have 
                    experience with Visual Studio (2010, 2012, 2017, 2022), JetBrains IntelliJ 
                    (briefly), Eclipse (Java only), and of course Notepad++. I prefer simpler
                    environments that, while they do have plenty of customizations, still focus on
                    running quickly and not being the obstacle to development.
